I'm a 18 year old student. I mainly do backend stuff and discord bots.
I previously had 3 summer jobs as a developper (developped interfaces using React and Angular.js)

I mostly code in Python, but I can also code in Javascript, Typescript, PHP. 

I'm working at [@Futuradios](https://github.com/futuradios) as a developper.
